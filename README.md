# Interpreter for the Functional-Logic Language CuMin

This is an implementation of an operational semantics (i.e. an interpreter) for the functional-logic language CuMin.
It was part of [my bachelor's thesis](https://github.com/fanzier/cs-bsc-thesis), which describes this language and its semantics in detail.

I currently don't maintain this project anymore.
